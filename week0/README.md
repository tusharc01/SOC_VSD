### The Modern Open-Source Digital IC Design Flow (RTL-to-GDSII)

This is the flow used to turn HDL code into a physical layout ready for fabrication. The tools you mentioned (`Qflow`, `Magic`) are key parts of this.

| Stage | Primary Tool | Purpose | Alternatives / Complementary Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. RTL Design & Sim** | **GHDL** / **Icarus Verilog** | Simulates and checks the logic of your Verilog/VHDL code. | Verilator (very fast, used for large designs) |
| **2. Synthesis** | **Yosys** | Converts the high-level RTL (e.g., Verilog) into a gate-level netlist (list of standard cells and their connections). | `qflow` is a script that *uses* Yosys |
| **3. Floorplanning** | **OpenROAD** / **Graywolf** | Places the major macro blocks (CPU, SRAM), defines the chip core area, and places input/output (I/O) pins. | `qflow` uses these tools |
| **4. Placement** | **OpenROAD** / **Graywolf** | Determines the precise location of each standard cell on the die. | `qflow` uses these tools |
| **5. Clock Tree Syn.** | **OpenROAD** / **TritonCTS** | Builds a network to distribute the clock signal to all sequential elements (flip-flops) with minimal skew. | |
| **6. Routing** | **OpenROAD** / **TritonRoute** | Connects all the placed cells together with metal wires according to the netlist. | `qflow` uses these tools |
| **7. STA & P&R** | **OpenSTA** (Static Timing Analysis) | Analyzes the design to ensure all timing constraints (setup/hold times) are met after Place & Route. | **Opentimer** (another open-source STA tool) |
| **8. Physical Verif.** | **Magic** (DRC, LVS) | **DRC (Design Rule Check):** Ensures the layout meets the foundry's manufacturing rules. **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic):** Ensures the physical layout matches the original gate-level netlist. | **KLayout** (another excellent viewer/DRC tool) |
| **9. Simulation** | **NGSPICE** / **Xyce** | Performs analog simulation on the final extracted netlist (which includes parasitic resistances and capacitances) to check for final timing and signal integrity issues. | |

### The All-in-One Solution: OpenLANE

Programs like the VSD Tapeout Program heavily rely on **OpenLANE**. OpenLANE is not a single tool but an **automated toolchain** that scripts and manages the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow above. It seamlessly integrates:
*   Yosys (Synthesis)
*   OpenROAD (Floorplanning, Placement, CTS, Routing)
*   OpenSTA (Timing Analysis)
*   Magic (for DRC/LVS)
*   ...and other tools.

Using OpenLANE is often easier than manually running each `qflow` step, which is why it has become the de facto standard for open-source tapeouts.

### Analog / Mixed-Signal IC Design Flow

This is for designing circuits like amplifiers, sensors, PHYs, etc.

| Stage | Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Schematic Capture** | **Xschem**, **eSim** | Drawing the circuit diagram. |
| **Simulation** | **NGSPICE** (gold standard), **Xyce** | Simulating the analog circuit behavior (DC, AC, transient analysis). |
| **Layout** | **Magic** (industry-standard for open-source), **KLayout** | Drawing the physical geometries (transistors, wires) of the circuit. |
| **Analog Verification**| **Magic** (with `netgen`), **KLayout** | Running DRC and LVS on the analog layout. |



Necessary EDA tools for IC design:
*   **Virtual Box:** For Windows users to run Linux.
*   **NGSPICE:** Essential for simulation.
*   **Magic:** Essential for layout and verification.
*   **Opentimer:** A good open-source STA tool, but **OpenSTA** (integrated with OpenLANE) is more common now.
*   **eSim:** A good educational suite (based on KiCad and NGSPICE), but many advanced users prefer **Xschem** for schematic entry.
*   **Qflow:** A useful scripted flow, but largely **superseded by the more robust and automated OpenLANE** for modern projects.
